This is a starcraft AI script intended for the Hydra Starcraft Mod: http://www.fraudsclub.com/hydra/
It is is designed for a specific map in which the compute player starts with 3 towns, one for each available race.

The AI starts with additional workers (currently 8).

The town location numbers and locations can be referanced in this image.
